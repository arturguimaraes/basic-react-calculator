## Live Application

Click [here](https://arturguimaraes.github.io/basic-react-calculator/) to go to the application.

## Installation

To install all required packages, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run:
```sh
npm install
```

To start the application, run:
```sh
npm start
```

## Introduction

This is a basic calculator application built using React and TypeScript. It allows users to perform simple arithmetic operations and has additional features like percentage calculation and support for Playwright tests.

## Template Usage

This application was created by running the create-react-app command and adding the Typescript template.
```sh
npx create-react-app react-basic-calculator --template typescript
```

## Extra Packages

This project uses the following additional packages:

- Sass: For styling the components.
- React Redux and Reduxjs Toolkit: To manage application state.
- Uuid: To generate unique ids.
- Playwright: To automate end-to-end testing.
- GitHub Pages: To publish the application for live using.

## How To Use

The calculator works similar to others. To use it, first input a number, then select an operator, and then input another number. Press '=' to get the result or continue pressing other operators to perform further calculations.

Please note that if you input a number after pressing '=', your previous sum will be lost. To use the percentage button, first input the percentage number, then press '%', then input the number you want to calculate the percentage of, and finally press '='. For example, to calculate 10% of 500, input "10", press "%", input "500", and then press "=" to get the result, which should be 50. The AC button clears everything.

## Playwright Tests

The end-to-end tests were built with the Playwright library.

To run the Playwright tests, first start the application by running:
```sh
npm start
```

Then, in a separate terminal window, run:
```sh
npm run playwright
```

A report in HTML format will be automatically generated and opened in your default browser. If the report does not open, run:
```sh
npm run playwright-report
```

Alternatively, you can navigate to the `playwright-report` folder and manually open the generated file.

To quit the tests, press Ctrl + C.
